# AidConnect: Autonomous Incident Detection and Aid Dissemination using Agentic AI

> *‚ÄúInstead of victims searching for help ‚Äî we built a system where help finds them.‚Äù*

---

## Overview

**AidConnect** (Originally named AlertKarachi) is an **autonomous AI-powered system** designed to identify, verify, and route real-world incidents (e.g., crimes, accidents, emergencies) from social media directly to the relevant authorities, NGOs, and media outlets after verification.  

The goal is to **bridge the gap between affected individuals and support organizations**, ensuring that help reaches victims faster and more efficiently.  

This project was built as part of a **Built With AI Hackathon funded by Google Developer Groups**, where it secured **2nd Position** for its innovation and real-world impact.

## üí° Problem Statement

In many underprivileged areas, people lack awareness about where and how to seek help during emergencies.  
For instance, when a family loses its breadwinner during a robbery, they might file an FIR(First Information Report) to nearest police station but have no access to or knowledge of NGOs, financial support, or media coverage.  

According to official reports, only 2% of such incidents receive media attention, leaving countless cases unnoticed and unaided.  

Meanwhile:
- **NGOs** are actively searching for genuine cases to support.  
- **Media outlets** look for real human-impact stories.  
- **Victims** post their problems on social media but never reach structured help.  

AidConnect fills all these gaps using Agentic AI.

## üöÄ Solution

AidConnect is a fully autonomous **multi-agent AI system** that continuously monitors and analyzes social media discussions to detect ongoing or emerging incidents.  

### How It Works:
1. **Data Scraping:**  
   Using Social Media APIs, the system gathers posts related to distress events (crimes, emergencies, etc.) being discussed by multiple users.

2. **AI Summarization:**  
   The collected data is processed by Gemini AI, which extracts key insights and generates a short, structured incident summary.

3. **Verification:**  
   The system autonomously sends this summary to the relevant department (e.g., police) via WhatsApp Business API to confirm the authenticity of the report.

4. **Dissemination:**  
   Once verified, the incident is automatically shared with NGOs and media outlets, enabling them to take timely action.

5. **Outcome:**  
   - Victims receive faster aid and visibility.  
   - NGOs discover verified cases efficiently.  
   - Media gains credible human stories to highlight.  

> The entire process, from detection to dissemination, runs autonomously through coordinated AI agents.

## Key Innovations

- **Autonomous Agentic AI Workflow:**  
  No manual intervention, incidents are detected, verified, and routed automatically and displayed on a dashboard.  

- **Reverse Aid-Seeking Model:**  
  Traditional systems expect victims to find help; AidConnect brings help to them.  

- **Cross-Platform Integration:**  
  Combines multiple APIs, Social Media, WhatsApp, Firebase, into a seamless workflow.  

- **Multi-Stakeholder Connectivity:**  
  Bridges the communication gap between the public, NGOs, media, and law enforcement.  

- **AI-Powered Verification and Summarization:**  
  Uses Gemini AI to transform noisy, unstructured data into verified actionable insights.
