# AidConnect: Autonomous Incident Detection and Aid Dissemination using Agentic AI

> *‚ÄúInstead of victims searching for help ‚Äî we built a system where help finds them.‚Äù*

---

## Overview

**AidConnect** (Originally named AlertKarachi) is an **autonomous AI-powered system** designed to identify, verify, and route real-world incidents (e.g., crimes, accidents, emergencies) from social media directly to the relevant authorities, NGOs, and media outlets after verification.  

The goal is to **bridge the gap between affected individuals and support organizations**, ensuring that help reaches victims faster and more efficiently.  

This project was built as part of a **Built With AI Hackathon funded by Google Developer Groups**, where it secured **2nd Position** for its innovation and real-world impact.

## üí° Problem Statement

In many underprivileged areas, people lack awareness about where and how to seek help during emergencies.  
For instance, when a family loses its breadwinner during a robbery, they might file an FIR(First Information Report) to nearest police station but have no access to or knowledge of NGOs, financial support, or media coverage.  

According to official reports, only 2% of such incidents receive media attention, leaving countless cases unnoticed and unaided.  

Meanwhile:
- **NGOs** are actively searching for genuine cases to support.  
- **Media outlets** look for real human-impact stories.  
- **Victims** post their problems on social media but never reach structured help.  

AidConnect fills all these gaps using Agentic AI.

---

## üöÄ Solution

AidConnect is a fully autonomous **multi-agent AI system** that continuously monitors and analyzes social media discussions to detect ongoing or emerging incidents.  

### How It Works:
1. **Data Scraping:**  
   Using Social Media APIs, the system gathers posts related to distress events (crimes, emergencies, etc.) being discussed by multiple users.

2. **AI Summarization:**  
   The collected data is processed by Gemini AI, which extracts key insights and generates a short, structured incident summary.

3. **Verification:**  
   The system autonomously sends this summary to the relevant department (e.g., police) via WhatsApp Business API to confirm the authenticity of the report.

4. **Dissemination:**  
   Once verified, the incident is automatically shared with NGOs and media outlets, enabling them to take timely action.

5. **Outcome:**  
   - Victims receive faster aid and visibility.  
   - NGOs discover verified cases efficiently.  
   - Media gains credible human stories to highlight.  

> The entire process, from detection to dissemination, runs autonomously through coordinated AI agents.

## Key Innovations

- **Autonomous Agentic AI Workflow:**  
  No manual intervention, incidents are detected, verified, and routed automatically and displayed on a dashboard.  

- **Reverse Aid-Seeking Model:**  
  Traditional systems expect victims to find help; AidConnect brings help to them.  

- **Cross-Platform Integration:**  
  Combines multiple APIs, Social Media, WhatsApp, Firebase, into a seamless workflow.  

- **Multi-Stakeholder Connectivity:**  
  Bridges the communication gap between the public, NGOs, media, and law enforcement.  

- **AI-Powered Verification and Summarization:**  
  Uses Gemini AI to transform noisy, unstructured data into verified actionable insights.

## ‚öôÔ∏èHow to Run This Project
This is a **Next.js application** integrated with **Google‚Äôs Genkit and Gemini AI**, designed to autonomously identify and report social impact incidents using AI workflows and real-time social data.

---
### Prerequisites
1. **Node.js** (version 18 or higher)
2. **npm** or **yarn** package manager
3. **Google AI API key** (for Gemini AI functionality)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Step 2: Set up Environment Variables
You'll need to create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with your Google AI API key:

```bash
# Create the environment file
touch .env.local
```

Add the following to `.env.local`:
```
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key_here
```

**To get a Google AI API key:**
1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Create a new API key
4. Copy the key and paste it in your `.env.local` file

### Step 3: Run the Development Server
The project has multiple run modes:

**For the main Next.js application:**
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start the development server on port 9002 (http://localhost:9002)

**For the AI/Genkit development server:**
```bash
npm run genkit:dev
```
This runs the AI flows and tools separately.

**For watching AI changes:**
```bash
npm run genkit:watch
```
This runs the AI server with file watching enabled.

### Step 4: Access the Application
- **Main App**: http://localhost:9002
- **AI Dashboard**: The Genkit server will show its own URL when started

### Available Scripts
- `npm run dev` - Start Next.js development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run typecheck` - Run TypeScript type checking
- `npm run genkit:dev` - Start AI development server
- `npm run genkit:watch` - Start AI server with file watching
